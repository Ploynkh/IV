While it's tempting to trust this result (after all, we would like to be able to obtain better classification performance), it is wiser to practice some skepticism: any sign of overfitting is something to be worried about, esp for large and complex models such as NNs. Oftentimes our dev and test sets give us an optimistic idea of how different from training data future data points may be. So, we generally prefer models that exhibit higher accuracy or macro F1 _while_ also exhibiting a reasonable dev loss behaviour."

        "Run an experiment with the complete dataset (remember that for that you need to re-run `prepare_nltk_corpus` to get all data points via `portion=1.0`, you also have obtain a fresh Vocabulary object and update it with all known words as well as with the words in GloVe, you should also reconstruct the embedding matrix since the vocabulary changed, and finally reconstruct the `LabelledCorpus` objects for each of the splits), try the base configurations of the two models (they should get about 90 and 94 macro F1 on dev, respectively). Be warned that the BiLSTM can take up to 10 minutes on CPU.\n",

        "For reference, a naive Bayes classifier using bag-of-words features gets about 91 macro F1 on dev. Because this dataset is rather small, NBC is a very strong baseline (meaning, it is difficult to beat it). NNs have many more parameters and they can easily overfit to small datasets (that's why we use dropout, pretrained frozen embeddings, etc). In larger datasets and also especially for more difficult tasks, NNs often have an edge over NBC."
